# RTEL 24/25

All the work carried out on this repository was done as part of the final project for FEUP's Telecommunications Networks course ([M.EEC055]).

## Network Traffic Simulator

The objective in the course is to develop a ongoing simulator of network traffic, with mathmatical models.

### Part 1

To run a single simulation, in only one mode and just a set of parameters, use the following command:

```python main.py <lambda> <mu> <max_capacity> <total_calls_target / sim_time> <mode> [delta] ```

To have a set of combination of simulations, alter the `main_auto.py` with the wanted set of parameters, and run it like so:

``` python main_auto.py ```

### Results

An compilation of results can be seen in the [Results] folder.
